### Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | --- |  
| App | This will render the UI | 
| Switcher | will handle all the routes | 
| Log-in Page | log in for existing users | 
| Create Account | create new user account |
| Newsfeed | scrolling list of photos | 
| Nav | includes two icons | 
| Footer | add photo button, profile button, newsfeed button | 
| Add photo form | Add a photo and give it a caption | 


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| App | H | 3hrs | 2hrs | 2hrs |
| Switcher | H | 3hrs| 1hrs | 1hrs |
